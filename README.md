# PCARepel

Many times the values in Principal Componentes or other mutivariates ordinations are overlapped. Even if the graphic in package ade4 are very clear and flexible, sometimes the overlapped of the variables is a problem. I decide to develop a little function using the packages: ggord and ggrepel for PCA from the analyisis of package ade4
